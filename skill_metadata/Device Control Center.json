  "switch between skipping and requiring wake words": "If you are in devMode, your commands are limited to the following in order to avoid false-positives:     -   require {ww}     -   quit skipping {ww} and     -   skip {ww}     -   begin skipping {ww} where *{ww}* stands for wake words. If you are in user mode, you can use the following commands to use wakewords:     -   solo mode     -   I am in (a group |group)     -   I am not alone     -   use {ww}     -   require {ww}     -   begin requiring {ww}     -   stop (skipping {ww} |solo mode )     -   end (skipping {ww} |solo mode )     -   deny (skipping {ww} |solo mode )     -   quit (skipping {ww} |solo mode ) And the following to start skipping the wakewords:     -   I am alone     -   skip {ww}     -   start ( skipping {ww} | solo mode )     -   begin ( skipping {ww} | solo mode )     -   allow ( skipping {ww} | solo mode )     -   enter ( skipping {ww} | solo mode ) Most likely, Neon will ask for the confirmation to most of the choices available above. Follow the prompts and reply either with simple positive or negative answer, or follow it up by the requested 3-digit code. Wait for the successful confirmation or action execution from Neon. Most commands should be instantaneous."
