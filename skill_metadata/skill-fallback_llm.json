    "description": "Converse with an LLM and enable LLM responses when Neon doesn't have a better response. To send a single query to an LLM, you can ask Neon to \"ask Chat GPT <something>\". To start conversing with an LLM, ask to \"talk to Chat GPT\" and have all of your input sent to an LLM until you say goodbye or stop talking for awhile. Enable fallback behavior by asking to \"enable LLM fallback skill\" or disable it by asking to \"disable LLM fallback\".",
