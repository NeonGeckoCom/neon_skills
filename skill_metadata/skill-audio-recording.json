    "description": "continuously record audio to file and disables wake words/STT while active, made for [ovos-dinkum-listener](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-dinkum-listener) A similar skill that saves text transcriptions instead of recording audio is [OpenVoiceOS/skill-ovos-dictation](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/skill-ovos-dictation) in order to avoid users accidentally locking themselves in recording mode a special kind of wake word called a *stop hotword* can be configured, these special hotwords are only used during recording mode and will restore the listener to default state if detected. By default no *stop hotword* is pre-configured when started via this skill a audio recording will time out after 4 minutes (max_recording_seconds in skill settings) if a `mycroft.stop` bus message is emitted (eg, \"stop\" via cli) the skill will take dinkum out of recording mode if recording was initiated by this skill **TODO**: dinkum should have a native (optional) timeout setting, using VAD to automatically stop recording after X seconds of silence",
